Project Video - CS 2022
Contributors - Aleksandr (Sasha) Kulda

Description:
This project is aimed at creating advertising for the UD Comp Sci program at the University of Dallas.
The video will be displayed on loop in the bottom of Haggerty Science Center, and alternates between showing off
games/projects created by students as well as video of anything involving the computer science department.


How to start:
First, if working on the project, install the latest version of HitFilm Express. It is free. You will
need to create an account and get a free liscense to access the project in full. Next, add to the project any video
you wish to add. Export at the top of the program, make sure the export is set to 1280x1080 resolution. Send the
mp4 file to Dr. Hochberg, and he will upload the video to the computer. Done!

Important things:
You need to keep the project at a resolution of 1280x1080 pixels
You will need a somewhat decent PC to operate HitFilm Express, talk to Hochberg if you do not have access to such
You will probably want to get used to using the video transitions under "effects". For the most part, I used the
"push" animation, setting motion blur to max for a better visual effect.
